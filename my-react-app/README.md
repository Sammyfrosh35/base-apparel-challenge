### What I learned
i learnt working with react states (use State) it makes it more reusable and i am happy i made my react project from start, at first it seems like impossible but with time i get to discover more and hope to improve more.

````jsx
 const [email, setEmail] = useState("");
  const [errorMessage, setErrorMessage] = useState("");

  const [error, setError] = useState(false);
````

### Continued development
i will like to work more on styling part the use of states so the active state can be exaclty as stated in the challenge.
